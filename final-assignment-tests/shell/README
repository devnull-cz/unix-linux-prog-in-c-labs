# These tests are for verifying correctness of the shell assignment
# implementation for NSWI015.
#
# If you find a bug in your implementation that is not covered in these tests,
# let us know and we can add a new test.  Ideally, send us a pull request.

Make sure variables in ./test-config are correctly defined, then run the
following.

# For phase 1
./run-tests.sh $( cat phase-1.tests )

Expected output is something like the following (the number of tests may
change):

$ ./run-tests.sh $( cat phase-1.tests )
=== [ NSWI015 mysh shell unit tests ] ===

001	PASS
