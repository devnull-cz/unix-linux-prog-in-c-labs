# report divisors of numbers in range [1, N]
   - create M threads (start with M = number of online CPUs in the system as reported by sysconf(3)
     - each thread computes the divisors of given number and then proceeds to the next number
       - or make it a tunable (a define or program option) and see what works best on given system
     - each thread continues processing until there is some work to do
       - keep it simple: in the initial version, there is no need to deal with queues/stacks etc.

   - main thread will report:
     - the best result found so far
     - the overall progress in percent (use \r to refresh the terminal)

  - hints/questions:
    - use refactoring to avoid long functions
    - use condition variable (one is enough)
    - how many mutexes do you need actually ?
    - start with single threaded program so that you can check the correctness (and debug easier)

  - check: [1, 100000]: the winner is 83160 that has 128 divisors

  - variants:
    - make this code generic so any sort of job can be used (e.g. convert this to parallelized port scanner/downloader/web crawler)
      - this is where the queue/stack/list comes into consideration 
    - pass the information about the best number to the main thread so that no single number is lost (i.e. use a queue)
    - do not report percentage update for each computation update but only when
      new winner is found
      - this has consequences: main thread needs to be aware of terminating
	threads
